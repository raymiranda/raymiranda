### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Ray Miranda

I enjoy working with DevOps and combining my passion for Software Development and Networking. I've been in the industry for 20 years and still look forward to learning and absorbing as much knowledge as possible.

Skills: PHP / Bash / Python / Golang / AWS Solutions Archtect

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few different projects that will allow me to share some of the things I hope will help others. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GoLang | DjangoRest | Anything focused on Automations.
